# AESExample
Author: Andrew Hansen, Jan 2021
This is my own implementation of the AES encryption system for the purposes of understanding the algorithm and its
implementation.  It goes without saying that this is not for use in production and is for academic purposes only.

AES.py is the main file and imports the others.  The other libraries also contain their own examples 
so they can be studied on their own.
